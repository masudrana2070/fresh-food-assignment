This project has two parts.
a. Server Part
b. Client Part
In the client part I first create fake data and then put into the database Mongodb and load all the information from the database in the home page.
####
Then create a private route in Admin panel and login panel in order to add product.
####
I also put private route in the home menu **##BUY NOW** button so that it will login and then go to the check out option. The checkout section is  working properly.
